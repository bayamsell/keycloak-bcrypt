# Keycloak Bcrypt

bcrypt is a password-hashing function 
designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res, 
based on the Blowfish cipher and presented 
at USENIX in 1999 (Thanks, 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)).

Natively, Keycloak does not support Bcrypt.
So you may need this plugin to add a 
new PasswordHashProvider, now using it.

For more information about this SPI, 
please take a look at [this class](https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/11.0/javadocs/org/keycloak/credential/hash/PasswordHashProvider.html)
and [this other page from keycloak's doc](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development).
